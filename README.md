## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository is a modern **e-commerce system clone prototype**, built with **React Native, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, and Stripe**.  
It simulates the core workflow of a real-world shopping platform:  

**Browse â†’ Cart â†’ Checkout â†’ Payment â†’ Order Tracking**

This project was **not launched commercially**, but served as a **hands-on exercise** to bridge **business-driven system design** and **technical implementation**.  
At the time, I was fascinated by the rapid growth of the e-commerce industry and wanted to practice designing a scalable platform from scratch.  

ðŸ‘‰ It pushed me to think like an **entrepreneur** (system scalability, business value) while building like an **engineer** (robust APIs, payment consistency, data security).  
It fundamentally changed how I evaluate **technical feasibility vs. commercial impact** in future projects.
