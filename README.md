## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository is a **clone prototype** of a modern **e-commerce system**, built with **React Native, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, and Stripe**.  
It simulates the core workflow of a real-world online shopping platform:  

**Browse â†’ Cart â†’ Checkout â†’ Payment â†’ Order Tracking**

âš¡ The prototype was **not launched commercially**, but served as a **hands-on exploration** of bridging **business-driven system design** with **technical implementation**.  
At the time, I was fascinated by the explosive growth of e-commerce and wanted to practice designing a scalable shopping platform from scratch.  

ðŸ‘‰ This project forced me to think **like an entrepreneur** (system scalability, business value) while building **like an engineer** (robust APIs, payment consistency, data security).  
It fundamentally changed how I evaluate **technical feasibility vs. commercial impact** in all my future projects.
